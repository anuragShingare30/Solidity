# Solidity Programming Language Guide ðŸ˜Ž


### SIMPLE STRUCTURE FOR SOLIDITY SMART CONTRACT.

- Here we will see the simple layout and structure to write the solidity smart contracts.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyFirstContract {
    // functions
    ...
    // variables
    ...
    // arrays
}

```


### VARIABLES IN SOLIDITY.

- Variables in sol is similar to javascript. Except address.

```solidity
uint8 , uint16, uint128, uint256;

string public str = "Hello world";

bool public correct = true/false;
```


### STRINGS AND BYTES.

- Strings are actually arbitrary long bytes in UTF-8 representation. Strings do not have a length property.

- When we are using 'string' as a parameter in our function define **memory** to allocate the memory to our string.

```solidity
string public myString = "Hello world";

function getMyString(string memory _myString) public {
    myString = _myString;
}
```


- Bytes have the length property.

```solidity
bytes public myBytes = "Hello";

// myBytes = 0x72375375bc758734784c834874
```


### BASIC FUNCTIONS TO WRITE SIMPLE S.C .

1. Here we will discuss the basic functions to write simple smart contracts.

```solidity
uint256 result;

function addition(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns(uint256){
    return result=a+b;  
}
```

2. When we are just returning an variable inside an function we will use 'view' keyword.

```solidity
function get() public view returns (uint256){
    return result;
}
```



### FUNCTION VISIBILITY.

1. **Public** : Can be used internally and externally.
- Our metamask wallet and other smart contracts can call this type of function.

```solidity
function addition() public {
    result+=10;
}
```

2. **Private** : Can be used within contract.

```solidity
uint256 result = 0;

function addition() private {
    result+=10;
}
```

3. **Internal** : Can be used within the contract and other inheriting contract.
- Our metamask cannot used the internal function.
- But, inheriting contracts can used this function.


```solidity

contract Children {

    uint256 public result = 0;
    function addition(uint256 num) internal {
        result+=num;
    }
}

contract Parent is Children {
    
    uint256 x;
    // Here we have use the function from child contract.
    // Inheriting.
    function checkSum(uint256 x) internal {
        add(x);
    }
}
```

4. **External** : Can only be accessed from external contracts or accounts.
- We cannot used this function internally inside an other function.
- Our metamask wallet can accessed this type of function.

```solidity
function add(uint256 num) external {
    result += num;
}
```

- The 'public' function uses more ethereum gas fees than 'external' function.



#### NOTE : The default behavior to error out if the maximum/minimum value is reached. But you can still enforce this behavior. With an 'unchecked' block. Let's see an example.

```solidity

uint256 num; // by default it is 0

// Error
function Test1() public {
    num--;
}

// 115758729374974893749972177129737
function Test2() public {
    unchecked{
        num--;
    }
}
```

### CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION 

- It is a special function that is called only once during contract deployment.
- It is automatically called during Smart Contract deployment. And it can never be called again after that.

```solidity
constructor(uint256 _myaddress) {
    owner = _myaddress;
    
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```


### PAYABLE MODIFIER

- The payable modifier tells solidity that the function is expecting eth to receive.

```solidity

string public myMessage;
function getMessage(string memory _myMessage) public payable {
    myMessage = _myMessage;
}

```


### msg OBJECT

- The msg-object contains information about the current message with the smart contract. 
- It's a global variable that can be accessed in every function.

```solidity
string public myMessage = "Hello World";

function updateString(string memory myMessage) public payable {
    if(msg.value == 1 ether) {
        myMessage = myMessage;
    } 
    else{
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value);
    }
}
```

- **msg.sender** is the address of the person who deployed the Smart Contract.  
- **msg.value** is used to get the amount of ETH sent along with a transaction to a smart contract.



### RECEIVE FUNCTION

- **Low-Level interaction** 
- This is the function that is executed on plain Ether transfers.
- The receive function is executed on a call to the contract with empty calldata.   
- The receive function can only rely on 2300 gas being available.


```solidity
uint public value;
string public message;

receive() external payable { 
    value = msg.value;
    message = "recieved";
}
```


### FALLBACK FUNCTION (Handling ether transaction)

- **Low-Level interaction**
- When Call-data field is filled, then we can call fallback function.
- If a payable fallback function is also used in place of a receive function, it can only rely on 2300 gas being available.
- The fallback function always receives data, but in order to also receive Ether it must be marked payable.
- If Ether is sent to the contract without any data or with data that doesn't match any existing function signatures, the fallback function is triggered


```solidity
uint public value;
string public message;

receive() external payable { 
    value = msg.value;
    message = "recieved";
}

fallback() external payable { 
    value = msg.value;
    message = "fallback";
} 
```

- **receive()** is a function that gets priority over **fallback()** when a calldata is empty.
- But **fallback** gets precedence over **receive** when calldata does not fit a valid function signature.  



#### SENDING ETHER TO SPECIFIC ADDRESS

- To send ETH on specific address we can use **transfer function**


```solidity
address payable toAddress;
toAddress.transfer(amountToSend);
```

- To receive an ETH on specific address, the address variable should also be an **payable**


#### NOTE : The **address(this)** expression refers to the contract's own address within its code.
#### **address(this).balance** returns the balance of the smart contract.




### MAPPING TYPES (mapping(KeyType => ValueType))

- Mapping types use the syntax **mapping(KeyType => ValueType)**
- The **KeyType** can be any built-in value type, bytes, string, or any contract or enum type.
- **ValueType** can be any type, including mappings, arrays and structs.

- It is an key and value datatype that does not have lenght or storage property.


```solidity
mapping (address => uint) public Balance;

function sendMoney() public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
}

function withDrawMoney(address to, uint amount) public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender] -= msg.value;
    to.transfer(amount);
}
```


- Understand the mapping as **key:value** pair.
- In mapping the datatypes has its default value initially.
- **mappings** do not have a length or a concept of a key or value being set.



### STRUCTS

- Solidity provides a way to define new types in the form of structs.
- Solidity uses structs to define new datatypes and group several variables together.
- A struct is a way to generate a new DataType, by basically grouping several simple Data Types together.

```solidity

// Defining struct
struct PaymentReceipt {
    address from;
    uint amount;
}

// THIS IS ONE METHOD TO ACCESS MAPS.
mapping (address => PaymentReceipt) public Balance;

function getPaymentHistory() public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender].amount = msg.value;
}


// ANOTHER WAY TO USE STRUCT.

PaymentReceipt public payment;
payment.from = msg.sender;
payment.amount = msg.value;

```


### NESTING MAPS IN STRUCT.

- Now, we will nest an map in an struct, so that it will become more easy and powerful to use struct with mappings.

```solidity
struct Transaction {
    uint amount;
    uint timestamp;
}

struct Payment {
    uint totalBalance;
    uint totalDeposit;
    mapping(uint => Transaction) deposits;
}

mapping (address => Payment) public Balance;

function deposit() public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender].totalBalance += msg.value;

    Balance[msg.sender].deposits[Balance[msg.sender].totalDeposit].amount = msg.value;
    Balance[msg.sender].deposits[Balance[msg.sender].totalDeposit].timestamp = block.timestamp;
    Balance[msg.sender].totalDeposit++;
}

function checkBalance(address _address) public view returns (uint){
    return Balance[msg.sender].totalBalance;
}
```

- By using **struct** inside an **mappings**, will be easier to handle the transaction.




### ARRAYS IN SOLIDITY.

- Just like an array in JS, arrays is solidity work exactly same.

```solidity
contract SampleArray {
    
    uint[] public dynamicArray;
    string[] public StringArray;

    function setValue(uint value) public {
        dynamicArray.push(value);
    }

    function getValue(uint index) public view returns (uint){
        return dynamicArray[index];
    }

    function deleteElement() public {
        dynamicArray.pop();
    }

    function sizeOfArray() public view  returns (uint){
        return dynamicArray.length;
    }
}
```
- An array can be of any data type (uint, string, struct, enum).





### ARRAY AND STRUCT (ARRAY AND JS OBJECT).

- An array can be of any data type (including **struct**) stored at specific index.

```solidity

struct StudentReport{
    string name;
    uint mark1;
    string HomeAdd;
}

StudentReport[] public ReportArray;

function fillReport(string _name, uint _mark1, string homeAddress) public {
    StudentReport memory ReportCard = StudentReport({
        name : _name,
        mark1 : _mark1,
        HomeAdd : homeAddress
    });

    ReportArray.push(ReportCard);
}

function getReportCard() public view returns(StudentReport[] memory){
    return (ReportArray)
}

```


### EXCEPTION HANDLING IN SOLIDITY.

1. **require() Statements** 

- **require(condition,"Error Occurred!!!")**
- It read as if condition is false it will throw an error exception with log statement.
- And, if it is true it will execute the remaining code.

```solidity

mapping (address => uint) public Balance;

function deposit() public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
}

function withDrawMoney(address payable to, uint amount) public payable {

    require(amount <= Balance[msg.sender], "Not enough funds!!!");
    Balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    to.transfer(amount);
}

```

- **require()** statement works exactly opposit to if-else statements.


2. **assert() statements** (DON'T KNOW WHEN TO USE???)

- Assert is used to check invariants
- Those are states our contract or variables should never reach, ever.

```solidity

mapping (address => uint8) public Balance;

function deposit() public payable {
    assert(msg.value == uint8(msg.value));
    Balance[msg.sender] += uint8(msg.value);
    assert(Balance[msg.sender] >= uint8(msg.value));
}

function withDrawMoney(address payable to, uint8 amount) public payable {
        
    require(amount <= Balance[msg.sender], "Not enough funds!!!");
    assert(Balance[msg.sender] >= Balance[msg.sender] - amount);
    Balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    to.transfer(amount);
}

```


3. **try/catch statements**

```solidity

contract ExampleTryCatch {

    // THIS FUNCTION WILL ALWAYS FAIL TO EXECUTE.
    function tryCatch() public pure {
        require(false,"Error Occurred!!!");
    }
}

contract ErrorHandling {
    event ErrorLogging(string reason); 
    event ErrorLoggingCode(uint errorcode);

    function handlingError() public {
        ExampleTryCatch test = new  ExampleTryCatch();

        try test.tryCatch(){
            // do something
        }
        catch Error(string memory reason){
            emit ErrorLogging(reason);
        }
        // Panic is for assert (optional)
        catch Panic(uint errorcode){
            emit ErrorLoggingCode(errorcode);
        }
    }
}

```


### LOW-LEVEL SOLIDITY CALLS (INTERACTING WITH TWO SMART CONTRACT).

- Low-Level solidity call refers to **recieve the funds from other smart contracts.**



```solidity
contract ContractOne {

    mapping (address => uint) public Balance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        Balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function checkBalance() public view returns (uint){
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    // 2. REQUIRES FALL-BACK FUNCTION TO RECIEVE THE FUNDS FROM DIFFERENT SMART CONTRACTS.
    receive() external payable { 
        deposit();
    }
}


contract ContractTwo {
    receive() external payable { }

    function DepositInContractOne(address to, uint amount) public {

        // 1. 
        ContractOne one = ContractOne(to);
        one.deposit{value:amount, gas:100000}();

        // 2. REQUIRES FALL-BACK FUNCTION.
        (bool send,) = to.call{value:amount, gas:100000}("");
        require(send);
    }
}

```

- Here, we have two methods to recieve funds from low-level calls.

1. WITHOUT FALL-BACK FUNCTION

```solidity
ContractOne one = ContractOne(to);
one.deposit{value:amount, gas:100000}();
```

2. WITH FALL-BACK FUNCTION

```solidity
(bool send,) = to.call{value:amount, gas:100000}("");
require(send);
```



### EVENTS

- This provide logging facility of Ethereum.
- Events are a way to access this logging facility

```solidity
// SAMPLE SMART CONTRACT TO UNDERSTAND THE EVENTS.
contract Events {
    mapping(address => uint) public Balance;

    events(address _from, address _to, uint _amount);

    constructor(){
        Balance[msg.sender] = 100;
    }

    function sendTokens(address _to, uint _amount) public payable{
        require(Balance[msg.sender] >= _amount, "No Enough MOney");
        Balance[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        Balance[_to] += _amount;

        emit(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    }
}

// THE LOGS WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE 'logs' FIELD IN OUTPUT.
```


### MODIEFIERS, INHERITANCE AND IMPORTS IN SOLIDITY.

- Let's see a simple smart contract and how we can use the modifiers, inheritance and imports in our smart contracts.

```solidity
// InheritedContract.sol
contract InheritedContract{

    mapping (address => uint) public Account;
    address owner;

    constructor(){
        owner = msg.sender;
        Account[owner] = 100;
    }

    modifier isOwner(){
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not allowed");
        // placeholder input
        _;  
    }
}


// InheritedContract.sol

import "InheritedContract.sol";
contract InheritedContract is InheritedContract {

    event History(address _from, address _to, uint _amnt);

    function createNewToken() public isOwner{
        Account[owner]++;
    }

    function burnToken() public isOwner{
        Account[owner]--;
    }

    function sendToken(address _to,uint _amount) public payable {
        require(Account[msg.sender] >= _amount);
        Account[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        Account[_to] += _amount;

        emit History(msg.sender, _to, _amount);

    }
}

```


#### MODIFIERS

- Right now we have several similar require statements.
- To avoid code duplication and make it easier to change this from a single place, we can use modifiers


```solidity
modifiers onlyOwner(){
    require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not allowed");
    _;
}

function sendTokens() public onlyOwner{
    // some code...
}
```

#### INHERITANCE

- By inheritance we can make two or more smart contracts.
- And, we can use the function of second inherited smart contract.

```solidity
contract Owned {
    address owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not allowed");
        _;
    }
}


contract Sample is Owned{
    // sample code...
}

```


#### IMPORTS

- Now, we export smart contract from one file to another using importing.

```solidity
// Ownerable.sol

contract Owned {
    address owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not allowed");
        _;
    }
}

// SAMPLE SMART CONTRACT
import "./Owned.sol";

contract SampleSmartContract is Owned {
    // some code...
}

```

- We can inherit the smart contract from one file to another file.




### CONTRACT TO CONTRACT INTERACTION (INTERFACE)

- Sometimes we are required different smart contract to handle some conditions necessary to our DApps.
- Just like in (ReactJs -> Componenets) we have smart contract to handle conditions.

```solidity
// Test1.sol
contract ContractA {
    uint data;

    function setData(uint _data) public {
        data = _data;
    }
    function getData() public view returns(uint){
        return data;
    }
}

// Test2.sol
interface IContractA {
    function setData(uint _data) external;
    function getData() external view returns (uint);
}

contract ContractB {
    IContractA public contractA;
    // sc address wil be of the interfaced contract address
    constructor(address _smartcontractAddress) {
        contractA = IContractA(_smartcontractAddress);
    }
    
    function setDataInContractA(uint _data) external  {
        contractA.setData(_data);
    }
}

```


### WITHDRAW MONEY FROM SMART CONTRACT

- After minting an nft's the price will be stored in smart contract and not in owners balance.
- To withdraw money,


```solidity
function withDrawMoney(address _address) external payable {
    uint balance = address(this).balance;
    payable(_address).transfer(balance);
}
```

- **address(this)** will return the current smart contract address.


### INTRODUCTION TO WEB3.JS

- **Web3.js** is a JavaScript-library that lets us interact with a blockchain node via its RPC interface or Websockets.
- Here, there are **JavaScript functions** to interact with a blockchain node.


#### WEB3 PROVIDERS (WEBSOCKETS PROVIDERS).

- Web3.js is not sending the requests directly, it abstracts it away into these providers (EIP-6963, EIP-1193).
- Here, we can have example of metamask which automatically connects with website.
- Similarly, for **Web3 Providers** lastly it is connecting to the blockchain node.



#### ABI(Application Binary Interface) ARRAY.

- It is used to interact with smart contracts.
- **ABI ARRAY** provides web3js, what functions are present in smart contract.
- The **ABI Array** contains all functions, inputs, as well as all variables and their types from a smart contract

```solidity
// THIS IS THE SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF ABI ARRAY.
let abiArray = [
	{
		"inputs": [],
        // name : variables, functions,
		"name": "setData",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "uint256",
				"name": "",
				"type": "uint256"
			}
		],
		"stateMutability": "view",
		"type": "function"
	},
]
```


#### INTERACTION WITH SMART CONTRACT (web3.eth)

- We can use **Web3** libraries to interact with our smart contract.
- **web3.eth** provide us different methods/functions to interact with smart contract


```solidity
// TO GET THE ACCOUNTS
(async () => {
  const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
  console.log(accounts);
  console.log(accounts.lenght);
})()
```

- To interact with smart contract we have,

```solidity

// SAMPLE SMART CONTRACT
contract setData {
    uint public data = 100;

    function setData(uint _data) public {
        data = _data;
    }
    function getData() public view returns(uint){
        return (data);
    }
}


// JS CODE TO INTERACT WITH SMART CONTRACT
(async ()=>{

    // TO GET ALL ACCOUNTS
    let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();

    let SmartContractAddress = "";
    let abiArray = [
	{
		"inputs": [],
		"name": "myInt",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "uint256",
				"name": "",
				"type": "uint256"
			}
		],
		"stateMutability": "view",
		"type": "function"
	},
];

    let contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abiArray,contractAddress);
    
    // TO UPDATE ANY STATE VARIABLE
    async function setData(newData){
        await contract.methods.setData(newData).send({from : accounts[0]});
    }

    // TO DISPLAY/READ DATA
    let result = await contract.methods.getData().call();
    console.log(result);

})();

```

- From above code we can interact with smart contracts.

1. **new web3.eth.Contract()  ->  myContract.methods.myMethod().call()**  To call an variable

2. **new web3.eth.Contract() -> myContract.methods.myMethod({from:account[0]}).send()**  To update variable or function with params.



### WORKING OF IPFS(InterPlanetary File Storage) and CID(Content Identifier).

- IPFS is a decentralized P2P distributed file storing protocol.
- Storing data on blockchain is way expensive. So, the company store their data on **centralized server and cloud providers**
- In IPFS, files and other data are stored in a network of nodes.
- When a file is added to IPFS, it is split into smaller blocks, hashed using hash algorithm (SHA-256).
- This hash is called as **CID(Content Identifier).** 
- Everytime re-uploading file a new CID is generated.
- To retrieve data, a user requests it using the hash. 
- IPFS locates the nodes storing the corresponding blocks and downloads them.


#### Location Addressing vs Content Addressing

1. Traditional web uses location-based addressing, where content is accessed by its location on a server (URL).

2. IPFS uses content-based addressing, where content is accessed by a hash of its content. This ensures that as long as the content remains the same, its address does not change.


#### PINNING SERVICE TO PINNED A NODE.

- If file is not in used in node using garbage collection process, file will be deleted.
- To prevent from garbage collection process we will use pinning service. 


### TYPES OF WEB3 STORAGE.

- **On-chain storage** refers to the practice of storing data directly on the blockchain, leveraging its inherent security features but at the cost of speed and expense. 

- **off-chain decentralized storage** involves storing data across a network of decentralized nodes or servers.

- **Off-chain private storage solutions** encompass traditional cloud-based and legacy data storage options designed for secure and controlled access.



### NFT METADATA

- NFT metadata is the sum of all data that describes an NFT, typically including its name, traits, trait rarity, link to the hosted image, total supply, transaction history, and other essential data.

- **NFT MetaData** contains all description for our NFT including image, image_url, description, attributes.

```json
// NFT-MetaData-Template

{
    "name":"Cryptodunks #101",
    "description":"",
    "image":"ipfs://QmXtHPbZoUNkUwGcZTcqD8TLRtozdxpjReMroioMPEvkSC/0.png",
    "attributes":[
        {
            "trait_type":"language",
            "value":"JavaScript"
        },
        {
            "trait_type":"OS",
            "value":"Windows"
        },
        {
            "trait_type":"Token",
            "value":"ERC-721"
        }
    ]
}

```

- We can see our minted and deployed NFT on opensea (Testnet) through Etherscan and also on our Metamask portfolio.



### Fungible and Non-fungible(NFT) token

1. **Fungible tokens(cryptocurrencies)** : These tokens are identical and can be exchanged for one another with equal value. Think of fungible tokens like currency
- interchangeable, identical in value (e.g., money).

2. **Non-fungible tokens(NFTs)** : These tokens are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis for something of equal value because each one has its distinct attributes.
- NFTs are often used to represent digital art, collectibles, or unique assets
- like a serial number or unique content
- unique, distinct in value (e.g., a rare collectible).


### TOPICS COVERED IN ERC - 721, 1155, 721A (Ethereum Request for Comment)

1. public mint function
2. mint multiple nfts
3. add uri function
4. view nfts on opensea
5. withdraw function
6. allowlist minting function
7. minting window to enable and disable
8. MAX LIMIT PER WALLET
9. Refund functionality and Refund time period
10. Testing smart contract on Testnet



### TOKENS(ERC-20,721,1155,1155A)

- **Token** is a representation of something in the digital or physical world that resides on the Ethereum blockchain
- Managed by a smart contract, which is a program on Ethereum, a token can represent just about anything. 
- **It can be fungible(cryptocurrency) and non-fungible(NFT)**



#### ERC-20(Fungible) TOKEN

- ERC20 is a standard for **fungible** tokens, which are all identical and interchangeable.
- For tokens where every unit is the same (like currency).

**EXAMPLE**
- ERC20 is exactly the same as any other ERC20, just like how one dollar is the same as another dollar.


```solidity
// ERC-20 TOKEN SAMPLE CONTRACT FROM OZ
contract Web3 is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor()
        ERC20("Web3", "ERC20")
        Ownable(msg.sender)
    {
        _mint(msg.sender, 10000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
    
}
```
- A simple ERC20 token sample contract. Here, we can add minting,burning and allowance function further more...



#### ERC-721(Non-Fungible) TOKEN

- **For ERC721 you have one address that has many tokens and all unique. The SC also works same**.

- ERC721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens, meaning each token is unique and cannot be exchanged one-for-one with another.
- Each NFT has its own value based on its uniqueness.
- For unique, one-of-a-kind items (like art or collectibles).


**EXAMPLE**
- Think of an NFT for a unique piece of digital artwork. If you have a token representing **DigitalArt#1**, it's unique and can't just be swapped for **DigitalArt#2**




#### ERC-1155(Fungible and Non-Fungible) TOKEN

- **ERC1155** is a flexible standard that allows both **fungible and non-fungible** tokens within the **same smart contrac**t.
- This means you can create tokens that are all the same, all unique, or even some of each!
- A mix, allowing both identical and unique items in one contract 


**EXAMPLE**
- Imagine a game where you have coins(fungible) and weapons(non-fungible).
- With ERC1155, you can have GameCoins(all identical) and unique items like rare swords or shields, all in one place. 



#### COMMON FUNCTION IN ABOVE TOKENS


1. **PUBLIC MINT FUNCTION**

```solidity
function publicMint() public payable {
    require(true | false, "Minting is closed!!!");
    require(msg.value == 0.1 ether, "Not enough funds!!!");
    require(totalSupply() < 5, "We sold out!!!");
    uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
    _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);
}
```

2. **ALLOWLIST MINTING**

```solidity
function allowListMint() public payable {
    require(allowListAddress[msg.sender], "You are not in allow list!!!");
    require(true | false, "Minting is closed!!!");
    require(msg.value == 0.01 ether, "Not enough funds!!!");
    require(totalSupply() < 5, "We sold out!!!");
    uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
    _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);
}
```

3. **WITHDRAW FUNCTION**

```solidity
function withDrawMoney(address _address) external payable {
    uint balance = address(this).balance;
    payable(_address).transfer(balance);
}
```

4. **SET ALLOWLIST ADDRESS**

```solidity
mapping(address => bool) public allowListAddress;
function setAllowList(address[] memory addresses) external  onlyOwner{
    for(uint i=0;i<addresses.length;i++){
        allowListAddress[addresses[i]] = true;
    }
}
```

5. **PUBLIC MINTING (ERC-1155)**

- THE **amount** REFERS TO TOTAL NO. OF NFTs TO BE MINTED.

```solidity
uint constant public maxPurchasePerWallet = 3;

function publicMint(uint256 id, uint256 amount) public payable {
    require(true | false, "Minting is closed!!!");
    require(purchasePerWallet[msg.sender] + amount <= maxPurchasePerWallet, "MAX LIMIT PER WALLET REACHED");
    // by this require we can mint multiple nfts
    require(msg.value == (amount * 2 ether), "NOT ENOUGH MONEY SENT!!!");
    require(totalSupply(id) + amount <= maxSupply, "SORRY! WE MINTED OUT.");
    require(id < 5, "YOU ARE TRYING TO MINT WRONG NFTs");
    _mint(msg.sender, id, amount, "");
}
```

- **AllowListMint** function is same just add mapping of allowlist addresses.


6. **ADD URI FUNCTION (ERC1155)**

- This will return us the link for our **NFT Metadata through IPFS**
- We have added the IPFS Link this function will append NFT id and .json extension

```solidity
function uri(uint256 _id) public view virtual override returns (string memory){
    require(exists(_id), "URI : NOT EXIST");
    return
        string(
            abi.encodePacked(super.uri(_id), Strings.toString(_id), ".json")
        );
}
```


7. **PAYMENT SPLITTER (ERC-1155)**

- IT SPLITS BETWEEN THE ADDRESS(_payees) FOR SHARES(_shares).
- WE WILL ADD **address_array and shares_array** DURING DEPLOYMENT. 

```solidity
constructor(address[] memory _payees, uint[] memory _shares)
    ERC1155("ipfs://Qmaa6TuP2s9pSKczHF4rwWhTKUdygrrDs8RmYYqCjP3Hye/")
    Ownable(msg.sender)
    PaymentSplitter(_payees,_shares)
    {

    }
```
- This can be integrated in our DApps.



8. **PUBLIC MINT (ERC-721A)**

```solidity
function publicMint(uint256 amount) public payable  {
    require(msg.value == (publicPrice * amount),"NOT ENOUGH MONEY!!!");
    // returns the number of tokens minted by 'owner'
    require(_numberMinted(msg.sender) + amount < maxMintPerUser, "SORRY LIMIT REACHED FOR MINTING NFTs!!!");
    // returns the total amount of tokens minted in the contract
    require(_totalMinted() <= maxNFTMinting, "WE SOLD OUT!!!");
    _safeMint(msg.sender, amount);

    refundEndTimeStamp = block.timestamp + refundPeriod;
    for(uint i = _currentIndex - amount; i<_currentIndex; i++){
        refundEndTimeStamps[i] = refundEndTimeStamp;
    }
}
```

9. **REFUND FUNCTIONALITY**

```solidity
// refund functionality
function refund(uint tokenId) external payable {
    // check token expiry time stamp
    require(getTokenTimeStamp(tokenId) > block.timestamp, "REFUND PERIOD EXPIRED!!!");
    // you should be the owner of tokenid
    require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId), "YOU ARE NOT THE OWNER OF THIS TOKEN");

    // mark the refund
    hasRefunded[tokenId] = true;

    // Transfer Ownership of nft
    _transfer(msg.sender, refundAddress, tokenId);

    // refund the price
    uint refundAmount = getRefundAmount(tokenId);
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(refundAmount);
}   


// GET REFUND AMOUNT
function getRefundAmount(uint tokenId) public view returns (uint){
    if(hasRefunded[tokenId]){
        return 0;
    }
    return publicPrice;
}
```






### TRUFFLE


#### INSTALLING TRUFFLE

- npm install -g truffle (globally)
- mkdir project_name
- truffle init
- npm init -y
- echo "node_modules" > .gitignore
- npm i --save @openzeppelin/contracts


#### INSTALLING GANACHE

- This initialize the ganache rpc server
```js
npm i --global ganache
ganache 
```

- **add a network called "ganache" to the truffle-config.js file**

```js
// ganache-cli opens an RPC listener on Port 8545
module.exports = {
    networks: {
        ganache: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
            port: 8545,            // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
            network_id: "*",       // Any network (default: none)
        },
    }
}
```


#### MIGRATION FILE

- In truffle, we will use migration to deploy our sc.

```js
// migrations/01-web3-deployment.js
const Web3 = artifacts.require("Web3");

module.exports = function(deployer,network,accounts){
    deployer.deploy(Web3, {from:accounts[0]});
}
```

- **artifacts.require** function will scan the contents of the build/contracts folder from json and extract all relevant function from json.




#### TRUFFLE CONSOLE (GANACHE-CLI)

- Truffle has an integrated and interactive JavaScript console using ganache.

```js
// deploy our sc on ganache
truffle migrate --network ganache
// inititalize console
truffle console --network ganache
```

- Now, inside the console we can interact with our smart contract.
- **Run "migrate" to redeploy our sc inside console**


#### INTERACT WITH SC IN TRUFFLE CONSOLE

```js
// Create a new contract instance:
let token = await Web3.deployed();

// Truffle will scan the complete build artifacts directory and inject all contracts with their ABI and addresses directly in the console.
token.name();

// This way you can also mint an NFT
let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
await token.publicMint(accounts[0], 0.1 ether);
```
- Here **contract instance** will make a call (which you can see in Ganache) and return the output stored in the contract.
**Note : Truffle will scan the complete build artifacts directory and inject all contracts with their ABI and addresses directly in the console**



#### UNIT TESTING IN TRUFFLE (JS)

```js
// TO TEST OUR SC
truffle console --network ganache
migrate
test
```

- Truffle can do tests in JavaScript and solidity

```js
// test/Web3.test.js
const Web3 = artifacts.require("Web3");

contract("Web3", (accounts)=>{
    // first test check
    it("compare the two addresses for transaction" , async ()=>{
        let token = await Web3.deployed();
        assert.equal(accounts[0],accounts[1],"Alert!!! Transaction fraud");
    });

    // second test check
    it("Testing sample smart contract", async ()=>{
        let token = await Web3.deployed();
        let tokenName = await token.name();
        console.log(tokenName);
    });
})
```

- **Here each it(...) function represents new test, which expects a function as second params and msg as first params**

- Here, contract function gets all accounts which are injected by Truffle by doing a web3.eth.getAccounts() before starting the test.
- truffle uses Mocha, here instead of 'describe' we will use 'contract'.
- Truffle will automatically redeploy the contracts based on the migrations files to offer so called **"clean room testing"**



#### UNIT TESTING IN TRUFFLE (Solidity)

- You can't choose the account you're sending the TX from in Solidity. 
- You can't modify anything on the chain. 
- You can't listen to events.




#### Deploy Smart Contracts to a real Network (HD WALLET PROVIDER/INFURA/ALCHEMY)

- This is the most standard way to deploy sc which is also followed by hardhat and foundary also.
- Here, We start with Infura to deploy the Smart Contract



- We sign up with a service(**Infura**) that hosts these blockchain nodes and get access.
- The first thing we need to do is instruct Truffle to sign a transaction before sending it (using HDWALLET-PROVIDER)

```js
npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
touch .secret
echo ".secret" >> .gitignore
touch .infura
echo ".infura" >> .gitignore
```

- **.secret** : Add the secretPhrase from our metamask.
- **.infura** : Add the infura_project_id from infura dashboard
- **.etherscan** : To verify our sc on etherscan
 

- Here, we will not use '.env' because it is not good practice in terms of security.
- We will use 'fileSystem' to store our key.
- Use the **HDWalletProvider** in your network configuration.

```js
//  tailwind-config.js
const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
const fs = require('fs');
const mnemonicPhrase = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();
const infuraProjectID = fs.readFileSync(".infura").toString().trim();
const ETHERSCAN_ID = fs.readFileSync(".etherscan_id").toString().trim();


module.exports = {
    // ...
    networks:{
        sepolia: {
            provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonicPhrase, `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/${infuraId}`),
            network_id: 11155111,  // Sepolia's id
            confirmations: 2,      // # of confirmations to wait between deployments. (default: 0)
            timeoutBlocks: 200,    // # of blocks before a deployment times out  (minimum/default: 50)
            skipDryRun: true       // Skip dry run before migrations? (default: false for public nets)
      },
    }
}
```


- **Deploy our sc on sepolia using migrate**

```js
// inside truffle-console
truffle migrate --network sepolia
truffle console --network sepolia
```




#### Deploy Smart Contracts to a real network (Truffle Dashboard and METAMASK)

- We will use MetaMask to do the actual interaction with a blockchain. It's in there for a while, but not used very widely.

- Start with,
```js
// This will open an RPC tunnel to a website where MetaMask can connect to
truffle dashboard
truffle migrate --network dashboard
```

- **in this method we are not required to define the network in tailwind-config.js file**




#### Verification of SC on Etherscan

- login to your etherscan account and copy the API key.
- Save API key in .env or in fileSystem.

```js
npm install -D truffle-plugin-verify

//   tailwind-config.js
module.exports = {
  /* ... rest of truffle-config */
  plugins: ['truffle-plugin-verify'],
  api_keys:{
    etherScanId:process.env.ETHERSCAN_ID,
  },
}
```

- Simply, run the following command in terminal
```js
// FOR INFURA
truffle run verify Spacebear --network sepolia

// FOR DASHBOARD AND METAMASK
truffle run verify Spacebear --network dashboard
```


#### Solidity OptimizerÂ¶

- Reduces the gas needed for contract deployment as well as for external calls made to the contract.


```js
module.exports = {
    //...
    compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.8.16",      // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)
      // docker: true,        // Use "0.5.1" you've installed locally with docker (default: false)
      settings: {          // See the solidity docs for advice about optimization and evmVersion
       optimizer: {
        enabled: false,
        runs: 200
      },
      //  evmVersion: "byzantium"
      // }
    }
  },
}
```


#### FINAL tailwind-config.js

- Most of the time the **tailwind-config.js** will look like:

```js
// tailwind-config.js
const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
const fs = require('fs');
const mnemonicPhrase = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();
const infuraProjectID = fs.readFileSync(".infura").toString().trim();

module.exports = {

    plugins: ['truffle-plugin-verify'],
  api_keys: {
    etherscan: fs.readFileSync(".etherscan").toString().trim()
  },

  networks: {

    // GANACHE
    ganache:{
      host:"127.0.0.1",
      port:8545,
      network_id:"*",
    },
    // SEPOLIA
    sepolia: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonicPhrase, `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/${infuraId}`),
      network_id: 11155111,  // Sepolia's id
      confirmations: 2,      // # of confirmations to wait between deployments. (default: 0)
      timeoutBlocks: 200,    // # of blocks before a deployment times out  (minimum/default: 50)
      skipDryRun: true       // Skip dry run before migrations? (default: false for public nets)
  },
},

  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters, etc.
  mocha: {
    // timeout: 100000
  },

  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.8.16",      // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)
      // docker: true,        // Use "0.5.1" you've installed locally with docker (default: false)
      settings: {          // See the solidity docs for advice about optimization and evmVersion
       optimizer: {
         enabled: false,
         runs: 200
       },
      //  evmVersion: "byzantium"
      }
    }
  },
};

```



#### Debugging During Smart Contract Development (console.log)

```js
npm install @ganache/console.log

// import 
import "@ganache/console.log/console.sol";
```
- Start using the 'console.log' in your smart contract for debugging.

```js
ganache
truffle console --network ganache
migrate
```

- Try to mint an NFTs and you will see your console.log on the **ganache server**



#### Debugging already deployed Smart Contracts with Forking (Truffle Debugger)

- There it is, your contract, on Mainnet. But suddenly users are reporting a bug. Something isn't right.
- because your users funds are at stake, after all...


- Now,
- **Ganache can fork the mainchain** 
- **Truffle can debug smart contracts without even having the source code locally**


```js
// Pick any recent transaction from Etherscan and check it is verified smart contract.
ganache --fork.network sepolia

// Then you can use truffle to connect to Ganache, which will happily serve the requests.
truffle debug <TXHASH> --network ganache --fetch-external
```

- You can get the **TXHASH** from **Web3.json** file in networks object.

<!-- for ganache mainchain forking -->
- can fork mainchain/ testnet
- ganache downloads the code
- ganache offers debug-trace transaction rpc call (normal blockchain node do not offers this)

- Hit return a few times to see the actual execution of the code.
- Hit h for help and v for the current variables






### HARDHAT

- **artifacts** folder in our root directory contains our smart contract abi array.
- Hardhat comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development.
- It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code, all within the confines of your local machine


#### INSTALLING HARDHAT AND INITIALLIZING PROJECT

```js
npm init
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat init
npm i --save @openzeppelin/contracts
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```


#### Compiling contracts

- Start by creating a new directory called **contracts** and create a file inside the directory called **Web3.sol**

```js
npx hardhat compile
```


#### Testing contracts

**Note : Hardhat will run every *.js file in `test/`**

- Start the testing using following command : 
```js
npx hardhat test
```


- We will use **Ether.js and Mocha-Chai** for our testing.
- **Mocha-Chai is popular JavaScript assertion library**
```js
// installing ether.js and mocha
npm install ethers
npm install --save-dev mocha
```



- Create a new directory called **test** inside our project root directory and create a new file in there called **web3test.js**
- To test our contract, we are going to use Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development.

```js
//  test/web3test.cjs
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const assert = require('assert');

describe("Token contract", function () {
    // first test check
    it("Deployment should assign the total supply of tokens to the owner", async function () {

    // RETURNS THE ETHEREUM ACCOUNT. 
    // And, this account will execute the deployment
      const [owner, addr1, addr2] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // start the deployment of our token contract 
    // return a Promise that resolves to a Contract
    // This is the contract intance that has a method for each of your smart contract functions.
      const token = await ethers.deployContract("Web3");

    // Once contract is deployed, we can call contract methods using contract instance(token).
    // the account in the owner variable executed the deployment,
      const ownerBalance = await token.balanceOf(owner.address);

    // Here, the token's supply amount and we're checking that it's equal to ownerBalance, as it should be.
    // We have used expect(...) function from Mocha-chai to compare
      expect(await token.totalSupply()).to.equal(ownerBalance);

    //   either we can use expect(...) method or assert.equal(...) method
      assert.equal(await toke.totalSupply(), ownerBalance);
    });
  });
```

- Above, we can use either use **expect(...) or assert.equal(...) method**


##### Reusing common test setups with fixtures

- This setup could involve multiple deployments and other transactions. 
- Doing that in every test means a lot of code duplication. 
- Plus, executing many transactions at the beginning of each test can make the test suite much slower.


- To can avoid code duplication and improve the performance of your test suite we can use **fixtures**
- A fixture is a setup function that is run only the first time it's invoked.
- On every invocationshardhat will reset the state of networks. 

```js
const { loadFixture } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox/network-helpers");
const { expect } = require("chai");
const assert = require('assert');
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Token contract", function () {

    // deploy token fixtures
    async function deployTokenFixture() {
    const [owner, addr1, addr2] = await ethers.getSigners();

    const token = await ethers.deployContract("Token");
    await token.waitForDeployment();

    // Fixtures can return anything you consider useful for your tests
    return { token, owner, addr1, addr2 };
  }

    // first test check
    it("Deployment should assign the total supply of tokens to the owner", async function () {
    // for every test now we can use fixture instead of redepolying contract.
    const { token, owner } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);

    const ownerBalance = await token.balanceOf(owner.address);
    expect(await token.totalSupply()).to.equal(ownerBalance);
    assert.equal(await token.name(), "ERC721");
    });

    // second test check
    it("Test function", async function (){
        const { token, owner } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);
        // ...rest of code
    })
  });
```

**Note : To know more testing methods read hardhat testing docs (you know!!!)**


#### Debugging with Hardhat Network

- For debugging we will use **console.log()** in soilidity similar to JS.
- you can print logging messages and contract variables from your Solidity code.


```js
// contract/Web3.sol
import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract TestContract {
    // some code ...
    function publicMint() public payable{
        console.log("Amount transfer :", msg.value);
        // rest of code...
    }
}
```

- Lastly, run **npx hardhat test** to seee the result of debugging in terminal.



#### Deploying to a live network

- To run the deploy our smart contract use following code:
```js
// THIS INITITALIZE AN RPC SERVER
npx hardhat node

// DEPLOYING ON LOCALHOST
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.cjs --network localhost

// DEPLOYING ON TESTNET
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.cjs --network sepolia
```


- In Hardhat, deployments are defined through **Ignition Modules.** 
- Ignition modules are written inside **./ignition/modules directory.**

```js
// ./ignition/modules/deploy.js
const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");

const TokenModule = buildModule("TokenModule", (m) => {
  const token = m.contract("Web3");

  return { token };
});

module.exports = TokenModule;
```

- Now to deploy our smart contract we will initialize an RPC server locally in our terminal(port:8545)
- We need to modify our **hardhat.config.js** file.

```js
// hardhat.config.js

require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
const { vars } = require("hardhat/config");

// SET YOUR API KEY IN VARS AND NOT IN .ENV
// npx hardhat vars set API_KEY_NAME


const INFURA_API_KEY = vars.get("INFURA_API_KEY");
const SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY = vars.get("SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY");

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.27",
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      url: `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_API_KEY}`,
      accounts: [SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: vars.get("ETHERSCAN_ID"),
  },
  sourcify: {
    enabled: true,
  },
};

```

- Here, we are using **Infura blockchain node provider**



#### Store your API_KEY

- We will store our API_KEY, private_key and seed-phrase in **var** and not in **.env/.env.local**

```js
// RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMAND TO STORE THE KEY IN VAR
npx hardhat vars set API_KEY_NAME


// hardhat.config.cjs
const { vars } = require("hardhat/config"); 
const INFURA_API_KEY = vars.get("INFURA_API_KEY");
const SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY = vars.get("SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY");
```


#### Verify Smart Contract on etherscan

```js
// 1.
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
// 2.
npx hardhat ignition verify sepolia-deployment
```




### LIQUIDITY POOL (moneyjar -> smart contract)

- A liquidity pool on the Ethereum blockchain is like a big **money jar** filled with two types of tokens (ETH AND ERC-20).
- Here, people can trade directly with this jar, making it much faster and easier.
- Anyone who wants to trade ETH for DAI (or DAI for ETH) can use this jar.


#### Process followed when Pool is created and its Trading

1. **Creating Pool(Uniswap)** : A **liquidity pool** is created by someone who puts both **ETH and ERC** into a digital jar **(smart contract)** on platform like Uniswap.
2. **Trading** : Now, anyone who wants to trade ETH for DAI (or DAI for ETH) can use this smart contract(jar)
3. **Swapping** : When someone swaps ETH for DAI, the pool takes in ETH and gives out DAI.
4. **Pricing** : The prices adjust automatically based on how much ETH and DAI are in the jar.




### NFT STAKING SMART CONTRACT (ERC-20 AND ERC-721)

**In, NFT staking sc we will use both ERC20 and ERC721 token**

- An NFT staking sc is a type of program on the blockchain that allows **NFT holders(ERC721)** to **stake(or lock up)** their NFTs **in the contract for a certain period of time.**
- In exchange, they earn rewards, usually in the **form of tokens(ERC20)** or other benefits.
- Itâ€™s a way for NFT owners to gain extra value from their NFTs without selling them.


#### FLOW OF NFT STAKING SC

- To understand the process flow we will consider some basic tokens and contract : 

**Staking SmartContract(App)** : A contract with functions for staking, unstaking, and getting rewards (main function).
**ERC-721(NFT)** : The NFT that users lock up for a set period when staking.
**ERC-20(token)** : The reward token users earn when they unstake their NFTs.


1. **STAKING** : NFT holders connect their wallets to the staking platform and select an NFT they want to stake.
2. **Lock Period** : The NFT is locked and temporarily transferred to the smart contract for a specific time
3. **Rewards** : For keeping their NFT staked, users earn rewards like tokens, points. 
depending on the terms of the smart contract and company for which we are building
4. **Unstaking** : When the lock period ends, users can withdraw their NFT and collect any rewards they earned.

# Solidity Programming Language Guide ðŸ˜Ž


### SIMPLE STRUCTURE FOR SOLIDITY SMART CONTRACT.

- Here we will see the simple layout and structure to write the solidity smart contracts.

```js
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyFirstContract {
    // functions
    ...
    // variables
    ...
    // arrays
}

```


### VARIABLES IN SOLIDITY.

- Variables in sol is similar to javascript. Except address.

```js
uint8 , uint16, uint128, uint256;

string public str = "Hello world";

bool public correct = true/false;
```


### STRINGS AND BYTES.

- Strings are actually arbitrary long bytes in UTF-8 representation. Strings do not have a length property.

- When we are using 'string' as a parameter in our function define **memory** to allocate the memory to our string.

```js
string public myString = "Hello world";

function getMyString(string memory _myString) public {
    myString = _myString;
}
```


- Bytes have the length property.

```js
bytes public myBytes = "Hello";

// myBytes = 0x72375375bc758734784c834874
```


### BASIC FUNCTIONS TO WRITE SIMPLE S.C .

1. Here we will discuss the basic functions to write simple smart contracts.

```js
uint256 result;

function addition(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns(uint256){
    return result=a+b;  
}
```

2. When we are just returning an variable inside an function we will use 'view' keyword.

```js
function get() public view returns (uint256){
    return result;
}
```



### FUNCTION VISIBILITY.

1. **Public** : Can be used internally and externally.
- Our metamask wallet and other smart contracts can call this type of function.

```js
function addition() public {
    result+=10;
}
```

2. **Private** : Can be used within contract.

```js
uint256 result = 0;

function addition() private {
    result+=10;
}
```

3. **Internal** : Can be used within the contract and other inheriting contract.
- Our metamask cannot used the internal function.
- But, inheriting contracts can used this function.


```js

contract Children {

    uint256 public result = 0;
    function addition(uint256 num) internal {
        result+=num;
    }
}

contract Parent is Children {
    
    uint256 x;
    // Here we have use the function from child contract.
    // Inheriting.
    function checkSum(uint256 x) internal {
        add(x);
    }
}
```

4. **External** : Can only be accessed from external contracts or accounts.
- We cannot used this function internally inside an other function.
- Our metamask wallet can accessed this type of function.

```js
function add(uint256 num) external {
    result += num;
}
```

- The 'public' function uses more ethereum gas fees than 'external' function.



#### NOTE : The default behavior to error out if the maximum/minimum value is reached. But you can still enforce this behavior. With an 'unchecked' block. Let's see an example.

```js

uint256 num; // by default it is 0

// Error
function Test1() public {
    num--;
}

// 115758729374974893749972177129737
function Test2() public {
    unchecked{
        num--;
    }
}
```

### CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION 

- It is a special function that is called only once during contract deployment.
- It is automatically called during Smart Contract deployment. And it can never be called again after that.

```js
constructor(uint256 _myaddress) {
    owner = _myaddress;
    
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```


### PAYABLE MODIFIER

- The payable modifier tells solidity that the function is expecting eth to receive.

```js

string public myMessage;
function getMessage(string memory _myMessage) public payable {
    myMessage = _myMessage;
}

```


#### msg OBJECT

- The msg-object contains information about the current message with the smart contract. 
- It's a global variable that can be accessed in every function.

```js
string public myMessage = "Hello World";

function updateString(string memory myMessage) public payable {
    if(msg.value == 1 ether) {
        myMessage = myMessage;
    } 
    else{
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value);
    }
}
```

- **msg.sender** is the address of the person who deployed the Smart Contract.  
- **msg.value** is used to get the amount of ETH sent along with a transaction to a smart contract.



### RECEIVE FUNCTION

- **Low-Level interaction** 
- This is the function that is executed on plain Ether transfers.
- The receive function is executed on a call to the contract with empty calldata.   
- The receive function can only rely on 2300 gas being available.


```js
uint public value;
string public message;

receive() external payable { 
    value = msg.value;
    message = "recieved";
}
```


### FALLBACK FUNCTION (Handling ether transaction)

- **Low-Level interaction**
- When Call-data field is filled, then we can call fallback function.
- If a payable fallback function is also used in place of a receive function, it can only rely on 2300 gas being available.
- The fallback function always receives data, but in order to also receive Ether it must be marked payable.
- If Ether is sent to the contract without any data or with data that doesn't match any existing function signatures, the fallback function is triggered


```js
uint public value;
string public message;

receive() external payable { 
    value = msg.value;
    message = "recieved";
}

fallback() external payable { 
    value = msg.value;
    message = "fallback";
} 
```

- **receive()** is a function that gets priority over **fallback()** when a calldata is empty.
- But **fallback** gets precedence over **receive** when calldata does not fit a valid function signature.  



#### SENDING ETHER TO SPECIFIC ADDRESS

- To send ETH on specific address we can use **transfer function**


```js
address payable toAddress;
toAddress.transfer(amountToSend);
```

- To receive an ETH on specific address, the address variable should also be an **payable**


#### NOTE : The **address(this)** expression refers to the contract's own address within its code.
#### **address(this).balance** returns the balance of the smart contract.



### MAPPING TYPES (mapping(KeyType => ValueType))

- Mapping types use the syntax **mapping(KeyType => ValueType)**
- The **KeyType** can be any built-in value type, bytes, string, or any contract or enum type.
- **ValueType** can be any type, including mappings, arrays and structs.

- It is an key and value datatype that does not have lenght or storage property.


```js
mapping (address => uint) public Balance;

function sendMoney() public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
}

function withDrawMoney(address to, uint amount) public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender] -= msg.value;
    to.transfer(amount);
}
```


- Understand the mapping as **key:value** pair.
- In mapping the datatypes has its default value initially.
- **mappings** do not have a length or a concept of a key or value being set.



### STRUCTS

- Solidity provides a way to define new types in the form of structs.
- Solidity uses structs to define new datatypes and group several variables together.
- A struct is a way to generate a new DataType, by basically grouping several simple Data Types together.

```js

// Defining struct
struct PaymentReceipt {
    address from;
    uint amount;
}

// THIS IS ONE METHOD TO ACCESS MAPS.
mapping (address => PaymentReceipt) public Balance;

function getPaymentHistory() public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender].amount = msg.value;
}


// ANOTHER WAY TO USE STRUCT.

PaymentReceipt public payment;
payment.from = msg.sender;
payment.amount = msg.value;

```


### NESTING MAPS IN STRUCT.

- Now, we will nest an map in an struct, so that it will become more easy and powerful to use struct with mappings.

```js
struct Transaction {
    uint amount;
    uint timestamp;
}

struct Payment {
    uint totalBalance;
    uint totalDeposit;
    mapping(uint => Transaction) deposits;
}

mapping (address => Payment) public Balance;

function deposit() public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender].totalBalance += msg.value;

    Balance[msg.sender].deposits[Balance[msg.sender].totalDeposit].amount = msg.value;
    Balance[msg.sender].deposits[Balance[msg.sender].totalDeposit].timestamp = block.timestamp;
    Balance[msg.sender].totalDeposit++;
}

function checkBalance(address _address) public view returns (uint){
    return Balance[msg.sender].totalBalance;
}
```

- By using **struct** inside an **mappings**, will be easier to handle the transaction.



### EXCEPTION HANDLING IN SOLIDITY.

1. **require() Statements** 

- **require(condition,"Error Occurred!!!")**
- It read as if condition is false it will throw an error exception with log statement.
- And, if it is true it will execute the remaining code.

```js

mapping (address => uint) public Balance;

function deposit() public payable {
    Balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
}

function withDrawMoney(address payable to, uint amount) public payable {

    require(amount <= Balance[msg.sender], "Not enough funds!!!");
    Balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    to.transfer(amount);
}

```

- **require()** statement works exactly opposit to if-else statements.


2. **assert() statements** (DON'T KNOW WHEN TO USE???)

- Assert is used to check invariants
- Those are states our contract or variables should never reach, ever.

```js

mapping (address => uint8) public Balance;

function deposit() public payable {
    assert(msg.value == uint8(msg.value));
    Balance[msg.sender] += uint8(msg.value);
    assert(Balance[msg.sender] >= uint8(msg.value));
}

function withDrawMoney(address payable to, uint8 amount) public payable {
        
    require(amount <= Balance[msg.sender], "Not enough funds!!!");
    assert(Balance[msg.sender] >= Balance[msg.sender] - amount);
    Balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    to.transfer(amount);
}

```


3. **try/catch statements**

```js

contract ExampleTryCatch {

    // THIS FUNCTION WILL ALWAYS FAIL TO EXECUTE.
    function tryCatch() public pure {
        require(false,"Error Occurred!!!");
    }
}

contract ErrorHandling {
    event ErrorLogging(string reason); 
    event ErrorLoggingCode(uint errorcode);

    function handlingError() public {
        ExampleTryCatch test = new  ExampleTryCatch();

        try test.tryCatch(){
            // do something
        }
        catch Error(string memory reason){
            emit ErrorLogging(reason);
        }
        // Panic is for assert (optional)
        catch Panic(uint errorcode){
            emit ErrorLoggingCode(errorcode);
        }
    }
}

```


### LOW-LEVEL SOLIDITY CALLS (INTERACTING WITH TWO SMART CONTRACT).

- Low-Level solidity call refers to **recieve the funds from other smart contracts.**



```js
contract ContractOne {

    mapping (address => uint) public Balance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        Balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function checkBalance() public view returns (uint){
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    // 2. REQUIRES FALL-BACK FUNCTION TO RECIEVE THE FUNDS FROM DIFFERENT SMART CONTRACTS.
    receive() external payable { 
        deposit();
    }
}


contract ContractTwo {
    receive() external payable { }

    function DepositInContractOne(address to, uint amount) public {

        // 1. 
        ContractOne one = ContractOne(to);
        one.deposit{value:amount, gas:100000}();

        // 2. REQUIRES FALL-BACK FUNCTION.
        (bool send,) = to.call{value:amount, gas:100000}("");
        require(send);
    }
}

```

- Here, we have two methods to recieve funds from low-level calls.

1. WITHOUT FALL-BACK FUNCTION

```js
ContractOne one = ContractOne(to);
one.deposit{value:amount, gas:100000}();
```

2. WITH FALL-BACK FUNCTION

```js
(bool send,) = to.call{value:amount, gas:100000}("");
require(send);
```


### INTRODUCTION TO WEB3.JS

- **Web3.js** is a JavaScript-library that lets us interact with a blockchain node via its RPC interface or Websockets.
- Here, there are **JavaScript functions** to interact with a blockchain node.

- the **web3.eth** would go talk to the Blockchain Node you're connected to and execute a **JSON RPC call**.

#### WEB3 PROVIDERS (WEBSOCKETS PROVIDERS).

- Web3.js is not sending the requests directly, it abstracts it away into these providers.
- Here, we can have example of metamask which automatically connects with website.
- Similarly, for **Web3 Providers** lastly it is connecting to the blockchain node.



### ABI(Application Binary Interface) ARRAY.

- It is used to interact with smart contracts.
- **ABI ARRAY** provides web3js, what functions are present in smart contract.
- The **ABI Array** contains all functions, inputs and outputs, as well as all variables and their types from a smart contract

```js
// THIS IS THE SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF ABI ARRAY.
let abiArray = [
	{
		"inputs": [],
        // name : variables, functions,
		"name": "myInt",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "uint256",
				"name": "",
				"type": "uint256"
			}
		],
		"stateMutability": "view",
		"type": "function"
	},
]
```

### INTERACTION WITH SMART CONTRACT (web3.eth)

- We can use **web3** libraries in our Remix-IDE inside the **contracts folder**.
- **web3.eth** provide us different methods/functions to interact with smart contract


```js
// TO GET THE ACCOUNTS
(async () => {
  const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
  console.log(accounts);
  console.log(accounts.lenght);
})()
```

- To interact with smart contract we have,

```js

// SAMPLE SMART CONTRACT
contract ABIArray {
    uint public myInt = 100;

    function setInt(uint newInt) public {
        myInt = newInt;
    }
}


// JS CODE TO INTERACT WITH SMART CONTRACT
(async ()=>{

    let address = "";
    let abiArray = [
	{
		"inputs": [],
		"name": "myInt",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "uint256",
				"name": "",
				"type": "uint256"
			}
		],
		"stateMutability": "view",
		"type": "function"
	},
];

    let contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abiArray,address);
    console.log(await contract.methods.myInt().call());

    let account = await web3.eth.getAccounts();

	let result = await contract.methods.setInt(1000).send({from:account[0]});
	console.log(result);
	console.log(await contract.methods.myInt().call());
})();

```

- From above code we can interact with smart contracts.

1. **new web3.eth.Contract()  ->  myContract.methods.myMethod().call()**  To call an variable

2. **new web3.eth.Contract() -> myContract.methods.myMethod({from:account[0]}).send()**  To update variable or function with params.





### EVENTS

- This provide logging facility of Ethereum.
- Events are a way to access this logging facility

```js
// SAMPLE SMART CONTRACT TO UNDERSTAND THE EVENTS.
contract Events {
    mapping(address => uint) public Balance;

    events(address _from, address _to, uint _amount);

    constructor(){
        Balance[msg.sender] = 100;
    }

    function sendTokens(address _to, uint _amount) public payable{
        require(Balance[msg.sender] >= _amount, "No Enough MOney");
        Balance[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        Balance[_to] += _amount;

        emit(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    }
}

// THE LOGS WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE 'logs' FIELD IN OUTPUT.
```


### MODIEFIERS, INHERITANCE AND IMPORTS IN SOLIDITY.

- Let's see a simple smart contract and how we can use the modifiers, inheritance and imports in our smart contracts.

```js

contract InheritedContract{

    mapping (address => uint) public Account;
    address owner;

    constructor(){
        owner = msg.sender;
        Account[owner] = 100;
    }

    modifier isOwner(){
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not allowed");
        // placeholder input
        _;
    }
}


contract InheritanceModifiers is InheritedContract {

    event History(address _from, address _to, uint _amnt);

    function createNewToken() public isOwner{
        Account[owner]++;
    }

    function burnToken() public isOwner{
        Account[owner]--;
    }

    function sendToken(address _to,uint _amount) public payable {
        require(Account[msg.sender] >= _amount);
        Account[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        Account[_to] += _amount;

        emit History(msg.sender, _to, _amount);

    }
}

```


#### MODIFIERS

- Right now we have several similar require statements.
- To avoid code duplication and make it easier to change this from a single place, we can use modifiers


```js
modifiers onlyOwner(){
    require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not allowed");
    _;
}
```

#### INHERITANCE

- By inheritance we can make two or more smart contracts.
- And, we can use the function of second inherited smart contract.

```js
contract Owned {
    address owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not allowed");
        _;
    }
}


contract Sample is Owned{
    // sample code...
}

```


#### IMPORTING

- Now, we export smart contract from one file to another using importing.

```js
// Ownerable.sol

contract Owned {
    address owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not allowed");
        _;
    }
}


// SAMPLE SMART CONTRACT
import ".Ownerable.sol";

contract Sample is Owned{
    // sample code...
}

```

- We can inherit the smart contract from one file to another file.
